# Income Predictor - Deep Learning Model

A deep learning project built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify whether an individual earns **more or less than $50K annually**, based on demographic and employment features from the [Adult Census Income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income).

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Neural Networks** for binary classification using structured tabular data.  
It includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature encoding and scaling  
- Model building and evaluation  
- TensorBoard logging and visualization  
- Comparison between multiple neural network architectures

## Models Implemented

| Model | Description | Key Features |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Model 1 (Baseline)** | Simple feedforward NN | Two hidden layers (64, 32) |
| **Model 2 (Deeper)** | Deeper architecture | Three hidden layers (128, 64, 32) |
| **Model 3 (Regularized)** | Optimized architecture | Dropout, Batch Normalization, L2 Regularization |

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
